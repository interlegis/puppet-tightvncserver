This class installs and configures tightvnc server. 

It will install the package and configure it to launch when the machine boots and allows it to be run as a service

We made this module to compliment runthebusiness-guacamole.

Examples:

	tightvncserver{"installtightvnc":
	}


This module has been tested in debian squeeze. The init.pp and params.pp files have place-holders for the functionality to include other flavors. If you would like to contribute the code to enable these other flavors please let us know.
